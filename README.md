An airstrip overlooking a grey city rocked by artillery fire. A bland CIA Operative, flanked by Special Forces Men, stands in front of a commuter plane. CIA Man watches the Land Cruiser pull up, hard. The Militia Men jump out of the vehicle.

The Driver shoves the bespectacled man in front of the CIA Man.

CIA MAN:
Dr. Pavel, Iâ€™m CIA.

Dr. Pavel nods, nervous. CIA Man hands the Driver a briefcase.

BARSAD:
He wasnâ€™t alone.

CIA Man, confused, spots the Hooded Men. He turns to Dr. Pavel.

CIA MAN:
You donâ€™t get to bring friends.

DR. PAVEL:
They are not my friends.
BARSAD:
Donâ€™t worry, no charge for them.

CIA MAN:
Why would I want them?

BARSAD:
They were trying to grab your prize. (smiles) They work for the mercenary. The masked man.

CIA MAN:
(excited) Bane?

Barsad nods. CIA Man turns to his Special Forces Men.

CIA MAN:
Get â€™em on board - Iâ€™ll call it in.

EXT. SKIES OVER MOUNTAIN RANGE - DAY

The commuter plane struggles over snow-capped mountains.

INT. MAIN CABIN, COMMUTER PLANE - CONTINUOUS

The three Hooded Men kneel by the cargo door, handcuffed.

CIA Man grabs Hooded Man 1.
CIA MAN:
What are you doing in the middle of my operation?

Hooded Man 1 says nothing. CIA Man pulls out a handgun.

CIA MAN:
The flight plan I just filed with the Agency lists me, my men, and Dr. Pavel here! But only one of you!

CIA Man opens the cargo door. Special Forces hang Hooded Man 1 out into the howling wind - CIA Man shouts above the wind.

CIA MAN:
FIRST ONE TO TALK GETS TO STAY ON MY AIRCRAFT! (cocks weapon) SO...WHO PAID YOU TO GRAB DR. PAVEL?!

Nothing. CIA Man fires out the open door and the Special Forces yank Hooded Man 1 back in, clubbing him quiet.

CIA MAN:
HE DIDNâ€™T FLY SO GOOD! WHO WANTS TO TRY NEXT?!

The Soldiers grab Hooded Man 2, hang him out the door.

CIA MAN:
TELL ME ABOUT BANE! WHY DOES HE WEAR THE MASK?!

The prisoner says nothing. CIA Man presses the gun to the manâ€™s hood - he cocks the gun...nothing.

CIA MAN:
LOT OF LOYALTY FOR A HIRED GUN!
THIRD PRISONER (BANE):
Or heâ€™s wondering why someone would shoot a man before throwing him out of an aeroplane.

CIA Man turns to the Third Prisoner. Shuts the cargo door.

CIA MAN:
Wiseguy, huh? At least you can talk. Who are you?

THIRD PRISONER (BANE):
We are nothing. We are the dirt beneath your feet. And no one cared who I was until I put on the mask...

CIA Man, wary, approaches the Third Prisoner - pulls off his hood, revealing a dark mask with a breathing apparatus. The eyes behind it are cold. Still. This is Bane.

BANE:
Who we are does not matter. What matters is our plan.

CIA MAN:
(fascinated) If I pull this off, will you die?

BANE:
It would be extremely painful.

CIA MAN:
Youâ€™re a big guy.

BANE:
For you.
